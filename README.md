Hpc project parallel processing

Air pollution hotspot detection using time series  forecasting methods.

As we see around us in our day to day life pollution is becoming a serious threat in our day to day life. We as a team came up with a model to detect major pullotant hotspot in our country. We analysed dataset of around 4 lakh entries in our model and used various models to anayse data. As visualized data over various maps and correlation figures, giving better view of our problem. We integrated HPC in our project to reduce processing time for large dataset. We used libraries like pool and experimented over caffenet to get better results. Arima ans Sarima models are used. Its quite clear in results that Sarima gave better results
